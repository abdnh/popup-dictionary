### IMPORTANT NOTES ON THIS RELEASE

Please do not report bugs or issues through the review section below. Instead, **please use the official bug tracker for your feedback**. The known issues for this release include:

- Incompatibilities with other add-ons: At the moment there appear to be some issues with other add-ons that also modify the Reviewer in some fashion or another.
- Pop-ups not always appearing: There appear to be some issues with pop-ups not always appearing when double clicking on a word or phrase. In those instances you might want to use the hotkey instead (Alt+Shift+D / âŒ¥+â‡§+D).
- Hotkey not working: On some systems the hotkey might conflict with global key assignments or those added by other add-ons. In those instances please feel free to customize the hotkey by using the add-on config screen (see CONFIGURATION section).

<!-- CHANGELOG -->

### USAGE

Simply **double-click a word or phrase** on your card to draw up a pop-up of related information. Alternatively you can also highlight a phrase and then use the **Alt+Shift+D / âŒ¥+â‡§+D hotkey** to invoke the pop-up. To look up multiple words, either use the hotkey, or double click on one word and then drag your mouse until the rest of the phrase is highlighted. You can look up terms within pop-ups as well, and go as deep as you want with that (pop-up-ception ðŸ™‚).

### CONFIGURATION

There are a number of options you can customize in the add-on's config file. To change an option, simply head to Tools â†’ Add-ons â†’ Pop-up Dictionary â†’ Config and update the config values. All config values are documented in the explanations to the right of the screen. I'm planning on adding a graphical options menu in a future release.
